Nodes- Where actual dataset lies
Edges - Relationship between nodes

All tres are graphs but vice versa is not correct

graphs may or may not contain cycles

Cyclic - contains cycles
Acyclic-  not contains cycles

directed - which has direction
Undirected - which donot contain direction

All trees are directed and acyclic

Declare Weight/Cost in a graphs is called directed graphs and vice versa is termed as unweighted Graph

Connectivity

A graph may or may not contains connected component 
But disconnected component together can be termed as Graph and more precisely Disconected Graphs

Dense - let suppose A graph may contains more number of edges than nodes then it can be called as Dense Graph.

Where as,
Sparse - A graph which has many more entity but not connected to each other then it is callled  as Sparse graph.
